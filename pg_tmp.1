utility creates a temporary instance of PostgreSQL and prints the connection URL
to standard output.
.Nm
spawns a background process that initializes a new database under

which is used by subsequent invocations to reduce startup time.
The arguments are as follows:

sleeps and retries again after the same interval.

Use a TCP port selected by
.Xr getsocket 1
bound to 127.0.0.1.

.Ar start ,
and
